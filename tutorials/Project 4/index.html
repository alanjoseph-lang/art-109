        <h1>Project 4</h1>
        <h3>Mini Essay</h3>
        <p>Have you ever wondered what the Internet would look like in the future? We live in an era where we are so
            advanced that we sometimes forget that there is more to achieve. The internet for all it is, is still
            growing
            and developing, and we are just seeing the very tip of the iceberg in terms of its changes. So what does the
            future entail for the internet? I’ll be going over this question, sharing my speculations for the future of
            the
            internet.
        </p>

            Let’s start with the elephant in the room: AI. It is a tool that is already being integrated and is used by
            millions of people. It is a controversial topic right now, but it has the potential to be the nexus to our
            next
            big advancement. But what can it do with the internet? For starters, AI could potentially handle more menial
            tasks, acting like personal agents for users. It could automate a lot of infrastructure, which could
            massively
            improve convenience with the trade off of massive job losses. Although, AI development and maintenance
            careers
            may offset this by some amount. A good niche for it to occupy would be organization of info, allowing for
            easier
            access and a more efficient experience. Right now we already have an AI overview. This could expand to
            better
            judge credibility of sources, provide more accurate data, or derive its own conclusions. Rather than simply
            compiling and listing existing data, it could apply it to help us think beyond human limits.

            Another big development that can be seen in the distant horizon is the development of VR, AR, Advanced
            hardware,
            and direct brain connection technologies. All of these technologies have the potential to change the way we
            look
            at information and data at a massive scale. They will all allow for information to be much more tactile and
            tangible, making it far easier to learn and access data. It expands workspaces beyond just a small screen.
            The
            limit could become the range of your vision, or even your imagination. Beyond that, it would also allow for
            better collaboration over larger distances. This is incredibly big not just for the workforce, but also for
            general communication and even personal projects. It is especially beneficial for people that work with
            things
            that are very visual in nature, such as art, manufacturing, and more.

            Going beyond just the internet, I think its development also has the potential to change education as a
            whole.
            The developments I mentioned before could help with flexibility and creating a whole new level of efficiency
            with education. As a result, I believe the internet will be far more ingrained into the education system
            than it
            is now. AI has been incredibly controversial in this sector for a lot of reasons. While it could be argued
            that
            AI could just give prospective learners the answers, it could also be used to develop resources to study and
            teach. Teachers can use it to create flash cards, study guides, grade, and even develop their test/homework
            content. Oftentimes, because of the tediousness of creating these resources, they aren’t provided and
            students
            simply have to rely on their own notes. While taking notes is a good way to learn, doing that in conjunction
            with using practice resources would be far more effective. And rather than waiting for a teacher to answer
            questions or help, teacher-proctored AI can be used to help answer questions in real time and help students
            write their notes. VR and AR can be used to teach in a more immersive, tactile way that resonates better
            with
            certain students. This can also allow students to learn from anywhere, as they wouldn’t be bound to
            classrooms
            anymore.
        </p>

            Additionally, recorded lectures could better mimic the immersion of real lectures in conjunction with AI to
            tackle any real-time questions. Expanding on AI giving answers, it could change the very structure of
            education,
            as it could eliminate the need to learn certain content. Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is up
            to
            interpretation. The bright side of it is that we can learn at a higher capacity with it, having baseline
            knowledge, and providing answers to lower-level knowledge. The downside is that we may come to rely on AI as
            a
            crutch, which can doom us if we were ever to lose it somehow. It can also be argued that baseline skills
            need to
            be learned in order to progress to more advanced skills.

            Overall, there is a vast amount of potential for in internet in the coming decades. Between the development
            of
            AI and virtual spaces, there are a lot of directions that the new wave can take. But regardless of how the
            internet develops, it will most definitely make life and learning far more efficient, allowing for a higher
            quality of life as well as faster advancement in the long run. Something important to consider is whether
            this
            advancement can be made more sustainable, as there is no point in advancing if we destroy ourselves in the
            process. This means we not only work on making advancement less harmful in a physical context, but also in a
            social context.
