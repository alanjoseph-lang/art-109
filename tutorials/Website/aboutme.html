                    My name is Alan Joseph. I am 21 years old and I am a third-year college student attending San Jose
                    State University. I am currently pursuing a bachelor's in fine arts with a concentration in digital
                    media as well as a minor in Interaction Design.

                <p class="insidetext">
                    Thoughout my life, I have experienced working with many different mediums of digital media.
                    In my childhood, I enjoyed illustration, character design, and more traditional mediums. However,
                    as I grew older, I found myself pursuing digital art and growing more interested in graphic design
                    and branding. And now, as a college student, I have found a passion for UI/UX design and web design.
                    And so throughout my journey, I have developed niches for myself in various areas of digital media.
                    For the longest time I thought this was a bad thing, as I felt like I couldn't specialize in
                    anything. But now I realize that having a wide variety of skills and experiences is a strength in
                    itself, as it allows me to adapt to different situations and challenges with ease. I can put all 
                    my skills together in order to be adaptable and versatile in the field of digital media. With this 
                    mindset, I have come to consider myself a "digital swiss army knife", as I can take on many different 
                    roles and tasks. 
                </p>
                <p class="insidetext">
                    I am still exploring and learning more about the field of digital media and design as a whole, but I am
                    excited to see where this journey takes me. I hope that I can continue to develop new skills and hone 
                    my existing ones, and that I can use my talents to create meaningful and impactful work!
