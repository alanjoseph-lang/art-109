  <h1>Project 2:</h1>
  <h3>Timelapse Algorithms</h3>
  <p class="description">Description:</p>
  <p>For Project 2, I created a timelapse animation that showcases various algorithmic movements using p5.js.
          The animation consists of three distinct acts, each demonstrating different mathematical functions and motion
          techniques.
          In Act 1, I implemented the required sine wave pattern that smoothly oscillates across the canvas. I also
          implemented a kaleidescope
          pattern that I sourced and edited from the p5.js website. Act 2 features a strobe radial effect that pulses
          and a sequential radial dot
          pattern. Both also used the kaleidescope code from p5.js as a base. In Act 3, I made a spirograph pattern with 
          squares that rotate and change color continuosly. Although I did start off with the p5.js spirograph code,
          I used chatgpt to help figure out how to adjust the formula to my preference and how to implement it in code. I also included 2 sin waves 
          on the top and bottom of the canvas to frame the spirograph in the center. These waves have a lower amplitude and higher
          frequency and also have
          a slight phase shift. The shift goes left to right on the top sine wave, and right to left on the bottom wave. Finally, I 
          took a page from my exercise 3 & 4 and added a glow effect that gave all my algorithmic elements a strobe like effect.
          Overall, this project allowed me to put together my previous skills from the exercises such as developing classes, working 
          with trignometric functions, working with speed and motion, and more.
